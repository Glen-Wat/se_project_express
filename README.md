# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project powers the WTWR application, a weather app that helps you pick clothing suited to your locationâ€™s weather. I worked with databases, implemented security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote server. The goal was to create a server with a REST API and user authorization.
