# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for my WTWR application that I created. It's weather application that helps you pick the clothes to best suit the weather in your location. I worked with with databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
